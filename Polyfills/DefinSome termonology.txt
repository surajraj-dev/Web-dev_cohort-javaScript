                  A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality
                  on older browsers that do not natively support it.
            :-> A polyfill is a custom implementation of a built-in functionality that is not supported in older browsers. 
            :->It is a piece of JavaScript code that enables modern features in environments where they are not 
                natively available.

                                    Syntax : 
                                    if (!FeatureName.prototype.MethodName) {
                                        FeatureName.prototype.MethodName = function(args) {
                                            // Custom implementation of the method
                                        };
                                    }


  ðŸ”¹What is prototype?
        When a function or class is created in JavaScript, it automatically gets a special object called prototype. 
        This acts as a blueprint, storing methods and properties that can be shared across all instances (objects) created 
        from that function or class

  ðŸ”¹ What is __proto__?
           Every JavaScript object has a __proto__ property. This property holds a reference to the prototype 
           of its parent (constructor function). If an object does not have a certain property or method,JavaScript
            looks for it in its __proto__ (which points to the parentâ€™s prototype).


     
      ðŸ”¥ Simple Definitions:
            prototype â†’ A function/classâ€™s special object that acts as a blueprint for new objects.
            __proto__ â†’ A hidden property in every object that points to its parentâ€™s prototype.
