/*

üìå  Hoisting in JavaScript 
    Hoisting is JavaScript‚Äôs behavior of "appear" variable and function declarations to the top 
    of their scope before execution. 

    This happens inside the Global Execution Context (GEC) during the Memory Creation Phase.

    üîπ How TDZ Works Internally?
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Phase)

        let and const variables are hoisted but NOT initialized.
        They stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
        2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Phase

Accessing them before declaration throws a ReferenceError.
After declaration, they get initialized and can be used.

/*
üöÄ Deep Explanation (GEC + Hoisting)
    When JavaScript runs, it first creates the Global Execution Context (GEC), which has two phases:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting Phase)
    The JavaScript engine scans the code before execution.
    Variable and function declarations are stored in memory.
    var variables are hoisted with undefined, while let and const are kept in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
    Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning they can be called before their definition.
    
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Phase (Code Execution)
    The JavaScript engine executes the code line by line in the Call Stack.
    Variables get assigned actual values when their line executes.
    Function calls execute when encountered.
