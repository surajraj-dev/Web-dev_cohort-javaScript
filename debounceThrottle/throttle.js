    Throttling :->
          Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of a function to at most once per
           specified time interval, preventing it from being called too frequently."

    üî• Need for Throttle (Why Do We Use It?)
       :-> In JavaScript, some events fire continuously (e.g., scrolling, resizing, mouse movement), 
        causing performance issues when functions execute too frequently.
      :-> Throttle ensures a function executes at most once per specified time interval, preventing
       excessive execution and improving performance.

       üî• Highlight Use Cases
            :-> Scroll events (limits function execution while scrolling to improve performance).
            :-> Button clicks (prevents multiple clicks within a short time frame).
            :-> Resize events (reduces the frequency of re-rendering when resizing the window).
            :-> Mouse movement (optimizes event handling for animations and UI interactions).
            :-> API rate limiting (controls the number of API requests to prevent overload).
